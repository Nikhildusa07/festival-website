    <h2>About Bathukamma</h2>
    <p>
      Bathukamma is not just a festival of flowers, but a celebration of life, togetherness, 
      and cultural pride of Telangana. During this vibrant festival, women create beautiful 
      stacks of seasonal flowers, arranged in concentric layers to form a temple-like shape. 
      They gather in groups, sing traditional folk songs, and dance joyfully around the 
      Bathukamma, expressing devotion to <strong>Goddess Gauri</strong>. Beyond its religious 
      significance, Bathukamma reflects the deep bond between nature and people, showcasing 
      the respect for mother earth and the seasonal bloom of flowers. It is a symbol of 
      <strong>unity, love, and the rich cultural heritage of Telangana</strong>, passed down 
      from generation to generation with pride.
