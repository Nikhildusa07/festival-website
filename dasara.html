    <h2>About Dasara</h2>
    <p>
      Dasara, also known as <strong>Vijayadashami</strong>, is a grand festival that celebrates 
      the eternal victory of good over evil. It signifies the triumph of 
      <strong>Goddess Durga</strong> over the demon <strong>Mahishasura</strong> and the 
      victory of <strong>Lord Rama</strong> over <strong>Ravana</strong>, symbolizing courage, 
      righteousness, and truth. Across India, Dasara is celebrated with devotion and joy, 
      marked by processions, cultural performances, and the burning of Ravanaâ€™s effigies, 
      reminding people that evil, no matter how powerful, will ultimately fall before the 
      strength of virtue. More than a religious festival, Dasara inspires people to overcome 
      challenges in their own lives, embrace positivity, and walk on the path of truth and 
      justice. It stands as a vibrant reminder of Indiaâ€™s cultural unity, devotion, and 
      timeless values.
